# Data Vs Information :
- Data is the detail about any object, Say you got a details like

Suraj, 36,1989.

You don't have any detail about these values.
What is Suraj? Name or Surname,
What is 36? Is it his age or Waist Size,
What is 1989? Is it his year of Birth or Year of Joining


- Information is another piece of detail that adds meaning to the data.

- Meta Data:
 Any extra details about the data are called as Meta.
 Eg: Name should be String; it can be of max size=50

- Database:
It is a collection of Tables. Each table is the collection of Rows and columns, just like the excel sheet.

# Building Block Of Database

* Row or Tuple:
1. It represents all data required for a particular Instance in an Entity
2. Each row can be identified by declaring one column as Primary Key
3. The order of the rows is not significant, while retrieving the data

* Column or Attribute:
1. Represents one kind of data in a table vertically collected.
2. The column order is not significant while retrieving the data.

* Field
1. It can be found at an intersection of rows and columns
2. A field can have only one value, or may not have value at all
3. The absence of value is represented as NULL

* Connecting 2 tables:
1. Each table should contain data that describes exactly only one entity
2. Data about different entities is stored in different tables.
	All Customer data should be stored in customer table
	All Sales data should be sorted in Sales table.
3. We use foreign key to relate data across two tables.
4. A Foreign key is a column or a set of columns that refer to a primary key in the same table or another
table.
